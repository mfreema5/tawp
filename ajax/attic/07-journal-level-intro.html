<h3>Journal-level metrics</h3>

  <p>
    Journal-level metrics are the earliest metrics to become widely used, and continue to be influential. They measure the impact of journals in a research field using citation counts between journals; the citation cans can be used either directly or indirectly. Journal-level metrics were originally developed to aid librarians in selecting what journals to which to subscribe and maintain in their collections.

    But journal-level metrics have become a way to indicate the quality of a researchers publications. Presumably, the logic goes, a journal must publish the best articles in a field in order to have a high impact factor, so therefore any article published in a journal with a high impact factor must be of the best articles.
