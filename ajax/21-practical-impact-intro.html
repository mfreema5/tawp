<h2>Indicators of practical impact – examples from government initiatives and programs</h2>

  <p>
    There is a parallel shift in the nature of source materials when shifting topics from considering research quality—the impact of research on research—to considering practical impact—the impact of research on society at large. The outcomes of interest are no longer restricted within the world of research, and so neither are the source materials.

    Similarly, the examples used to discuss the evaluation of the practical impact of research are practical examples. They come from programs initiated and/or implemented by governments or government agencies in order to make funding for research institutions responsive, to some extent, to the practical impact of the research being produced by those institutions.
