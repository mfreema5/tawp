    Another way to rank journals based on prestige instead of simple popularity, is the approach used by Eigenfactor.org®, which “ranks the influence of journals much as Google’s PageRank algorithm ranks the influence of web pages” <a class="ref" onclick="fetchText('ajax/West_2015.html','11-West_2015')" href="#11-references">(West 2015)</a>.

    Bollen <em>et al.</em> <a class="ref" onclick="fetchText('ajax/Bollen_2006.html','11-Bollen_2006')" href="#11-references">(2006)</a> have also used the PageRank methodology to rank journals by prestige, using “the dataset of the 2003 ISI Journal Citation Reports to compare the ISI [Impact Factor] and Weighted PageRank rankings of journals.” To achieve the ranking, citations are used as a basis to “iteratively” pass prestige from one journal to the other, until “a stable solution is reached which reflects the relative prestige of journals.” This is an adaptation of the original PageRank method, the difference being that connections between journals are weighted, based on citation frequencies.

    Prestige and citation rankings were found to be largely similar, with two notable exceptions. The first were “journals that are cited frequently by journals with little prestige” that rank much lower on a prestige index than they do on a citation index. The second were the converse of the first, “journals that are not frequently cited, but their citations come from highly prestigious journals” so that they rank much higher on a prestige index than they do on a citation index.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on specific examples of these two types of journals that have distinctly different rankings when sorted by citations versus prestige, in general it is theory-heavy journals that have low citation counts, yet high prestige. The journals with high counts but low prestige are “methodological and applied journals” or ones “that frequently publish data tables” <a class="ref" onclick="fetchText('ajax/Bollen_2006.html','11-Bollen_2006')" href="#11-references">(Bollen <em>et al.</em> 2006)</a>.

    It is, however, unclear if this result is an indication of the importance of including work on theory to produce high-quality research, or simply evidence that a weighted PageRank methodology is effective at maintaining previous perceptions of the relative values of theoretical and applied research.
