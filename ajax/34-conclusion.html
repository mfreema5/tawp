<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Since institutions have limited resources they must regularly assess if those resources are allocated efficiently, in regard to meeting the institution's goals. For non-profit, public institutions the goal is to maximize the social benefits that result from the institution's activities, including research in a wide variety of fields.</p>
<p>Therefore, as part of the process of assessing the allocation of resources, those institutions must evaluate the beneficial outcomes of the work being done by researchers.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the focus of that evaluation has been on the positive that research has in its field, specifically by considering its influence, or potential influence, on subsequent research. That type of beneficial outcome has been evaluated under the classification of “research quality”. Bibliometric methods that analyze article citations in academic journals are one indicator of research quality; while they are sometimes over-emphasized, they are not without value for this purpose.</p>
<p>More recently, there has been interest in the outcomes of research that are beneficial outside of research institutions, and fields of research. This type of beneficial outcome can be evaluated under the classification of “practical impact”. To evaluate the practical impact of research, a qualitative, case-study based approach is typically recommend and/or used, since the effect of research may be felt in a wide range of areas, including economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits. Having the evaluation done by a panel of experts that includes the end-users of researchers helps ensure that the views of stakeholders outside of the research institutions are taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Quantitative indicators of practical impact are de-emphasized, since the effects in some areas are either conceptually difficult, or simply cost-prohibitive to quantify. Even when effects are quantifiable, they may not be quantifiable in an way that allows for equitable comparisons. Also, concise quantitative metrics can obscure complex realities, and have undue dominance over indicators with less of an appearance of objectivity.</p>
<p>Thus, citation-based bibliometrics have little utility for evaluating practical impact, though altmetrics, and other methodologies from the field of informetrics, may be able to contribute indicators of various kinds of the practical impact of research.</p>
