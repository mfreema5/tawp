<h2>Bibliometrics</h2>
  <p>
    The bibliometric methods used by fields as a measure of&mdash;or at least as a surrogate for the measure of&mdash;the impact of research can be divided into two general classes: journal-level metrics, and article-level metrics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Journal-level metrics rank the journals in field of research. It is generally assumed that any article published in a journal with a high “impact-factor” is of high quality, and therefore researchers with publications in high impact-factor journals are doing high quality research.
  </p>
  <p>
    Article-level metrics are more directly, and aggregate the data about all of an individual's published articles into a single measure, in order to give an indication of the quality of that researcher's work.
