# Rules for files to ignore
#
# A line starting with # serves as a comment.
# The prefix "!" negates a pattern; any matching file excluded 
#   by a previous pattern will become included again.
# If the pattern ends with a slash it will only match a directory.
# A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname.
# A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories.
# A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. 
# If the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell glob pattern.
